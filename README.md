### Experiment: Ollama and LangChain for Book Recommendation

This experiment utilizes the power of natural language processing and
graph networks to recommend books based on user preferences.

**Technologies:**

- Ollama: Knowledge graph representation and reasoning engine
- LangChain: Chain-of-thought based reasoning and explanation generation

**Objective:**

- Develop a recommendation engine that can suggest books based on user
  preferences and context.
- Explain the reasoning behind the recommendations.

**Methodology:**

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction:**

   - Extracted relevant textual data from books and Goodreads metadata.
   - Defined relationships between books, genres, authors, and concepts.

2. **User Preference Modeling:** - Developed a questionnaire to capture user preferences and contextual
   information. - Analyzed user responses using NLP techniques.

3. **Recommendation Engine:** - Utilized Ollama to represent the knowledge graph and user
   preferences as vectors. - Employed LangChain to generate chains of reasoning connecting books
   based on their textual and contextual features.

4. **Evaluation:** - Tested the recommendation engine on a group of users. - Measured the accuracy and diversity of the recommended books. - Analyzed the chains of reasoning generated by LangChain to
   understand the underlying connections.

**Expected Results:**

- A recommendation engine that can suggest books tailored to individual
  user preferences.
- Explanations for the recommendations in the form of chains of reasoning.
- Improved accuracy and diversity of recommendations compared to
  traditional methods.

**Future Work:**

- Integrate the recommendation engine with existing literary platforms.
- Expand the knowledge graph with additional data sources.
- Develop more sophisticated user preference models.
